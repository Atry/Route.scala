# Route.scala
[![route Scala version support](https://index.scala-lang.org/atry/route.scala/route/latest.svg)](https://index.scala-lang.org/atry/route.scala/route)

***Route.scala*** is the legacy Binding.scala routing library. For new project, [LatestEvent.scala](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/LatestEvent.scala) would be a simpler alternative to track URL and hash changes.

See the example in [todo app](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/todo/commit/54921cd4e1e7acf0b119b8bcd75c1a5c3f755f67#diff-96b7940afd1d65c4c49f5b434c0c764a2f1ecb133b12537b7144a8a05531457eR40-R43) for the migration to `LatestEvent.scala`.
